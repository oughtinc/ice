ICE is a Python library and trace visualizer for language model programs.

## Features

- Run language model recipes in different modes: humans, human+LM, LM
- Inspect the execution traces in your browser for debugging
- Define and use new language model agents, e.g. chain-of-thought agents
- Run recipes quickly by parallelizing language model calls
- Reuse component recipes such as question-answering, ranking, and verification

## ICE is pre-1.0

:warning: **The ICE API may change at any point.** The ICE interface is being actively developed and we may change the API at any point, including removing functionality, renaming methods, splitting ICE into multiple projects, and other similarly disruptive changes. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements

ICE requires Python 3.10. If you only have newer or older version(s) of Python installed, we recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install Python 3.10 and manage multiple Python versions.

If you use Windows, you'll need to run ICE inside of [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Getting started

1. As part of general good Python practice, consider first creating and activating a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid installing ICE 'globally'. For example:

   ```shell
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install ICE:

   ```shell
   pip install ought-ice
   ```

1. Set required secrets in `~/.ought-ice/.env`. See [`.env.example`](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice/blob/main/.env.example) for the format.

1. Start ICE in its own terminal and leave it running:

   ```shell
   python -m ice.server
   ```

1. To learn more, go through [the Primer](https://primer.ought.org/).

## Developing ICE

1. If you want to make changes to ICE itself, clone the repository, then install it in editable mode:

   ```shell
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat
   cd ui
   npm install .
   npm run dev
   ```

## Terminology

- **Recipes** are decompositions of a task into subtasks.

  The meaning of a recipe is: If a human executed these steps and did a good job at each workspace in isolation, the overall answer would be good. This decomposition may be informed by what we think ML can do at this point, but the recipe itself (as an abstraction) doesnâ€™t know about specific agents.

- **Agents** perform atomic subtasks of predefined shapes, like completion, scoring, or classification.

  Agents don't know which recipe is calling them. Agents donâ€™t maintain state between subtasks. Agents generally try to complete all subtasks they're asked to complete (however badly), but some will not have implementations for certain task types.

- The **mode** in which a recipe runs is a global setting that can affect every agent call. For instance, whether to use humans or agents. Recipes can also run with certain `RecipeSettings`, which can map a task type to a specific `agent_name`, which can modify which agent is used for that specfic type of task.

## Contributions

ICE is an [open-source](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice/blob/main/LICENSE.md) project by [Ought](https://ought.org/). We're an applied ML lab building the AI research assistant [Elicit](https://elicit.org/).

We welcome community contributions:

- If you're a developer, you can dive into the codebase and help us fix bugs, improve code quality and performance, or add new features.
- If you're a language model researcher, you can help us add new agents or improve existing ones, and refine or create new recipes and recipe components.

For larger contributions, make an issue for discussion before submitting a PR.
