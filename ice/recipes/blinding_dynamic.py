What does the paragraph say explicitly about whether the participants (i.e. the people who received the intervention) were blinded to whether they were in the treatment or control group?

Include all relevant quotes:
- Everything the study explicitly says about whether participants were blinded. If the paper says that the experiment was "open label", that means participants knew whether they were in the treatment or control group. So, the experiment was not blinded.
- All efforts that the research team made to prevent participants from figuring out whether they were in the treatment or control group, e.g.: (a) the researchers didn’t tell the control group about the intervention, (b) placebos that looked the same as the real drug were used.

If the paragraph does not say anything about whether participants were blinded, say "n/a".

Paragraph: Between the 26th and 29th of April 1998, all households in the intervention villages received a number of Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), according to the number of family members and were instructed explicitly about the correct use of the nets (Figure 2). Households in the control villages received identical-looking bed nets without insecticide treatment. More than 5000 ITN were distributed.

Paragraph: The study was an open randomized controlled clinical trial. After a census of the village population, subjects in the target age group were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized either to receive two intermittent preventive treatments with standard recommended treatment doses of SP or no intermittent preventive treatment.

Quotes from paragraph that say whether the participants in the "intermittent preventive malaria treatment (IPT)" intervention with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) were blinded to allocation:
"The study was an open randomized controlled clinical trial."
"Subjects who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized either to receive two intermittent preventive treatments with standard recommended treatment doses of SP or no intermittent preventive treatment."

###

Paragraph: To facilitate community-based treatment of malaria with the assigned regimen (artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine), and to ensure that children received the correct regimen if they attended at health centres in the study area, ID cards were colour-coded according to intervention group and labelled with the regimen to be used for case management. The study was therefore open-label with respect to the regimen used for case management but blinded with respect to whether seasonal malaria chemoprevention was active or placebo (members of the research team from KNUST/CGHR and LSHTM were aware of the allocation, but those who administered the SMC, and mothers/children were blinded).

Quotes from paragraph that say whether the participants in the "short-acting ACT for case management of malaria (artemether-lumefantrine, AL) plus placebo SMC" intervention were blinded to allocation:
"The study was therefore open-label with respect to the regimen used for case management but blinded with respect to whether seasonal malaria chemoprevention was active or placebo (members of the research team from KNUST/CGHR and LSHTM were aware of the allocation, but those who administered the SMC, and mothers/children were blinded)."

Paragraph: In India, the Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS) maintains a network of child-care centres, caring for children up to age 6 years and off ering the potential to deliver simple health interventions. In rural Uttar Pradesh in north India, our plans to use the ICDS infrastructure for a large cluster-randomised trial of the eff ects of 6-monthly deworming with albendazole on pre-school child mortality were revised into plans for a factorial trial that would also evaluate the eff ects on mortality of enhancing vitamin A coverage. This 5-year trial of Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A supple mentation (DEVTA) in 1 million pre-school children was larger than all other vitamin A trials combined. Its primary aim was to assess eff ects of a standard periodic treatment regimen on mortality at ages 1·0–6·0 years.

If the paper says that the experiment was "open label", that means personnel knew whether participants were in the treatment or control group. So, the experiment was not blinded. We want to know about blinding of all personnel, including personnel who administered the intervention and personnel who collected data.

Paragraph: "This was an open-label, randomised controlled trial enrolling asymptomatic schoolchildren and investigating the efficacy of IPTsc with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) or SP combined with piperaquine (PQ) on anaemia and malaria morbidity in Congolese schoolchildren. The trial was composed of three treatment arms: SP monotherapy; SP combined with PQ (SP/PQ); and no antima- larial treatment (control). The study was conducted in Mokali health area, a semi-rural area of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Malaria transmission is intense and perennial in this region, with two seasonal peaks (March–May and November–December) [19,20]."
